<h2>Untangling data is hard</h2>
Humans looking at raw numbers have a really hard time at understanding them.  
For example, it's almost impossible to say which of those 2 vectors have more variance just by looking at them.

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- sample(x = 18:65, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
y <- sample(x = 20:60, size = 10, replace = TRUE)
```
```{r results='markup'}
(x)
(y)
```

Stufff missing. Well, duh.

<h2>But, beware: Summary statistics can also be misleading!</h2>

... who takes summary statistics as the complete picture", Mr. T?  
Well said!

Beautifully illustrated by the 'datasauRus' package, summary statistics can also mislead you about the structure of a dataset/variable.  

--

For example, with a (Pearson's) correlation coefficient between two variables close to 0 we often immediately think of a relations between them like this:
```{r}
datasauRus::datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  filter(dataset == "h_lines") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + theme_void()
```
---

**But** datasauRus proves to us that various different relations with the same summary statistics are possible.

This one here has **the same correlation coefficient (-0.06, Pearson's)**.
```{r}
datasauRus::datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  filter(dataset == "slant_up") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + theme_void()
```
---

As does this one (again, -0.06):
```{r}
datasauRus::datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  filter(dataset == "dino") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point() + theme_void()
```
---

In fact, all of the following 12 datasets have the same mean, standard deviation, and Pearson's correlation.
```{r}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
 geom_point() +
 theme_void() +
 theme(legend.position = "none") +
 facet_wrap( ~ dataset, ncol = 3)
```
---

Let's prove it ourselves.  
The data_set looks like this
```{r}

```
