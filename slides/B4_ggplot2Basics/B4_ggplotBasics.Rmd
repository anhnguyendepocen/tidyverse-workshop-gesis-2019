# What is ggplot2?
`ggplot2` is an R-package to create plots.

It uses the "grammar of graphics"

- language for multi-dimensional data

- accordingly, it expects (a) data (frame) as input

- components of the plot are added as layers


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot_call +
  layer_1 +
  layer_2 +
  ... +
  layer_n
```


---
<h1> Plot examples </h1>

.pull-left[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./143_radar_chart_multi_indiv_2.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./21_ggplot2_ddensity_plot.png")
```
]


---
<h1> Plot examples </h1>

.pull-left[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./51_scatterplot_linear_model_with_CI_ggplot2.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./328_Hexbin_map_USA_4.png")
```
]

# Going deeper into the components of a plot
According to Wickham (2010, 8)* a layered plot consists of the following components:

- data and aesthetic mappings,

- geometric objects,

- scales,

- and facet specification

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot_call +
  data +
  aesthetics +
  geometries +
  scales +
  facets
```

# Data requirements
You can use one single data frame to create a plot in `ggplot2`.
- everything's on the plot is just data
- creates a nice and smooth workflow from data wrangling to the final presentation of the results


```{r data_science_pic, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/data-science_man.png")
```

--

But this makes it difficult to add extra features to your plot.
  - There are ways of doing it anyway as we will see later
  - Yet, it requires thinking about what to plot

---
<h1>  Why the long data format? </h1>

.left[ 
ggplot2 requires data to be in the long data format]

- in some scientific disciplines this format is only used for some specialized analyses, e.g., time series analysis


.pull-left[
We may want to get used to it as this format has some benefits

- every element we aim to plot is an observation
- no thinking required how a specific variable relates to an observation
  
- most importantly, the long format is more parsimonious
- it requires less memory and less disk space
]

.pull-right[
```{r long_pic, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/long.png")
```
]

# What if you want to create your own plot?

Theory on plots is boring as creating plots is all about practice...

...and stealing code from others


.column-left-half[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
please +
  no +
  more +
  pseudo +
  code +
  man
```
]

.column-right-half[
Three components are important:

- Plot initation

- data input

- aesthetics definition

- so called `geoms`
]


---
# Plot initation
.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_basic, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_basic", echo=FALSE}
```
]

But it doesn't show anything...


---
# Data input
.pull-left[
As we've already learned `ggplot()` expects data as input

```{r ggplot_data, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
titanic <- 
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv", 
    col_types = cols()
    ) %>% 
  na.omit()

ggplot(data = titanic)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_data", echo=FALSE}
```
]

Still nothing there...


---
# Aesthetics!
.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_aes, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_aes", echo=FALSE}
```
]

That's a little bit better, right?


---
# geoms!
.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_geom, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) +
  geom_point()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_geom", echo=FALSE}
```
]

A scatter plot!

---
# Add a line
.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_line, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_line", echo=FALSE}
```
]

...and a regression line!

---
#  Going further: add group asthetics
.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_group, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = titanic,
  aes(
    x = Age, 
    y = Fare, 
    color = Sex
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_group", echo=FALSE}
```
]


---
# Manipulate group asthetics
.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_group_man, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = titanic,
  aes(
    x = Age, 
    y = Fare, 
    color = Sex
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(
    palette = "Accent"
    )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_group_man", echo=FALSE}
```
]


---
# A note on manipulations

Working with combined aesthetics and different data inputs can become cumbersome.

Particularly, when plotting similar aesthetics interferring the automatic procedures can create conflicts.

My 'favorite' ones are:

- Multiple legends
  - and multiple color scales for similar `geoms` 
-
