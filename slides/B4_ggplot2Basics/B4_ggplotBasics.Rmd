# Graphics in `R`

Since its early days `R` has always been pretty helpful for creating graphics.

A standard `R` installation doesn't require any additional packages to create graphics.

--

```{r load_titanic, echo= FALSE}
titanic <- 
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv", 
    col_types = cols()
    ) %>% 
  na.omit()
```

.pull-left[
```{r graphics_hist, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
hist(titanic$Age)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "graphics_hist", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# What is ggplot2?

`ggplot2` is another `R` package for creating plots and is part of the `tidyverse`.

--

It uses the *grammar of graphics*

- well-suited for multi-dimensional data

- it expects data (frames) as input

- components of the plot are added as layers

--

```{r plot call, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot_call +
  layer_1 +
  layer_2 +
  ... +
  layer_n
```

# Histograms as in base `R`

```{r ggplot_histogram, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

---
# Components of a plot
According to Wickham (2010, 8)* a layered plot consists of the following components:

<span class="footnote">
<small><small><span class="red bold">*</span> http://dx.doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098</small></small>
</span>

--
- data and aesthetic mappings,

--

- geometric objects,

--

- scales,

--

- and facet specification

--
```{r plot call example, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plot_call +
  data +
  aesthetics +
  geometries +
  scales +
  facets
```

---

# Data requirements

You can use one single data frame to create a plot in `ggplot2`.
- everything on the plot is just data
- creates a smooth workflow from data wrangling to the final presentation of the results


```{r data_science_pic, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/data-science_man.png")
```

<small><small>Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz</small></small>

--

However, this makes it difficult to add extra features to your plot.
  - There are ways of doing it anyway as we will see later
  - Yet, it requires thinking about what to plot

---

# Why the long format?

ggplot2 requires data to be in the long data format

- in some scientific disciplines this format is only used for specialized analyses (e.g., time series analysis)


.pull-left[
We may want to get used to it as this format has some benefits:

- every element we aim to plot is an observation

- no thinking required how a specific variable relates to an observation

- most importantly, the long format is more parsimonious
    - it requires less memory and less disk space
]


.pull-right[
```{r long_pic, out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/long.png")
```

# Creating your own plot

We do not want to give a lecture on the theory behind data visualization.

- creating plots is all about practice

- ...and 'borrowing' code from others


.column-left-half[
```{r pseudo, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
please +
  no +
  more +
  pseudo +
  code +
  man
```
]

.column-right-half[
Three components are important:

- Plot initiation
- data input
- aesthetics definition
- so-called `geoms`
]


---
# Plot initiation

.pull-left[
`ggplot()` is the most basic command to create a plot:

```{r ggplot_basic, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_basic", echo=FALSE}
```
]

--

**But it doesn't show anything...**


---

# Data input

.pull-left[
As we've already learned `ggplot()` expects data as input

```{r load titanic data, message = F}
titanic <- 
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv", 
    col_types = cols()
    ) %>% 
  na.omit()
```


```{r ggplot_data, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_data", echo=FALSE}
```
]

--

**Still nothing there...**


---

# Aesthetics! 

.pull-left[
`ggplot` requires information about the variables to plot

```{r ggplot_aes, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_aes", echo=FALSE}
```
]

--

**That's a little bit better, right?**


---

# `geoms`!

.pull-left[
Finally, `ggplot` needs information *how* to plot the variables

```{r ggplot_geom, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) +
  geom_point() #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_geom", echo=FALSE}
```
]

--

**A scatter plot!**

---

# Add a line

.pull-left[
We can also add more than one `geom`

```{r ggplot_line, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = titanic) +
  aes(x = Age, y = Fare) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_line", echo=FALSE}
```
]

--

**A smoothed regression line!**

---

# Going further: adding group aesthetics

.pull-left[
We cann add different colors for different groups in our data

```{r ggplot_group, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = titanic,
  aes(
    x = Age, 
    y = Fare, 
    color = Sex #<<
    )
  ) +
  geom_point()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_group", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Manipulate group aesthetics

.pull-left[
We can also change the colors that are used in the plot

```{r ggplot_group_man, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(
  data = titanic,
  aes(
    x = Age, 
    y = Fare, 
    color = Sex
    )
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer( #<<
    palette = "Accent" #<<
    ) #<<
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "ggplot_group_man", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Talking about colors and theming...

The strength of ggplot2 lies in its theming capabilities.

--

This topic is rather complex and subject of a whole other course.

--

Yet, there are some built-in theming functions that makes theming of a plot really easy, e.g.,

- `theme_bw()`
- `theme_dark()`
- `theme_void()`
- etc.

See: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

--

We'd suggest to play with them in the exercise!





---
# A note on manipulations

.pull-left[
Working with combined aesthetics and different data inputs can become cumbersome.

Particularly, plotting similar aesthetics which interfere with the automatic procedures can create conflicts.

Some 'favorites' include:

- Multiple legends

- and various color scales for similar `geoms` 

- ... and there's more!

# Shortcuts

`ggplot2` is powerful...

- yet, it is admittedly somewhat complicated to use in the beginning

- and it has a steep learning curve

However, there are some conveniet shortcuts that you can use for creating simple plots.

---

# `qplot()` or `quickplot()`

.pull-left[
```{r qplot_example, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
qplot(
  x = titanic$Age, 
  y = titanic$Fare,
  geom = "point"
  )
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "qplot_example", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# `qplot()` or `quickplot()`

.pull-left[
```{r qplot_example_2, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
qplot(
  x = titanic$Age, 
  y = titanic$Fare,
  geom = c("point", "smooth") #<<
  )
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label = "qplot_example_2", echo=FALSE}
```
]
