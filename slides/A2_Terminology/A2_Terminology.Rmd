# The Power of Terminology
Maybe it's common sense to know what other people are talking about.

It's not just words, it's the understanding of them.

As you might know, in `R`, we use many different terms and concepts:

.column-left-half[

- object types, e.g.,
  - vectors
  - matrices
  - data frames
  - lists
- variables types
- etc.
]

.column-right-half[
```{r, out.width = "110%"}
include_graphics("./pics/9213.1526125966.png")
```
]

# Terminology of the tidyverse

The classic concepts of `R` are not subject of this sessions.

But `tidyverse` adds to this a whole new set of terms and concepts that have to be clarified. They may be foreign to us.

The good news is we're good with only three distinct concepts:

1. pipes
2. tibbles
3. (tribbles)


---
# What is a pipe?
```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("pipe office decoration.jpg")
```

You might know them from other scripting utilities such as `bash` (here a `|` operator is used).


---
# Nested Functions in Base R
First, let's load some data:

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
```

Say, if we aim to calculate the mean value of the variable `mpg` variable, as smart people we can fire up this command:

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
mean(read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))$mpg)
```

Pretty, isn't it? Well...


---
# Make it Prettier with Base R
We can use indentions to workaround issues with readablity:

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
mean(
  read_csv(
    readr_example("mtcars.csv")
    )$mpg
  )
```

This works. But it also has some serious flaws:

- Don't you dare to forget closing a bracket
- It's not easy to grasp which operation is the most important one
  - Is it loading the data?
  - Is it choosing the proper variable?
  - Or the calculation of the mean value?


---
# Disentangling and Overwriting
An easy way would be:

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

file_string         <- "mtcars.csv"
example_file        <- readr_example(file_string)
example_file_loaded <- read_csv(example_file)
mean(example_file_loaded$mpg)
```

Or, to prevent creating too many separate objects:

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

tmp_object          <- "mtcars.csv"
tmp_object          <- readr_example(tmp_object)
example_file_loaded <- read_csv(tmp_object)
mean(example_file_loaded$mpg)
```

Mix to your liking...


---
# Pipes as solution?
Pipes disentangle the whole process with an alternative approach by applying any involved function step by step:

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
"mtcars.csv" %>% 
  readr_example() %>% 
  read_csv() %>% 
  .$mpg %>% 
  mean()
```

Most importantly, the central dataset is now on top and the starting point of everything.

# Formal Defintion of Pipes: Basic Logic

Usually, in `R` we apply functions as follows:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
f(x)
```

In the logic of pipes this function is written as:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% f()
```

Thus, the inner argument/object is placed before the actual function call.


---
# Formal Defintion of Pipes: First Argument

In cases of multiple arguments `x` is always the first argument of the function.

Base R:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
f(x, y)
```

Piping:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(y)
```


---
# Formal Defintion of Pipes: . as Placeholder

Previously, we learned that `x` always refers to the first argument. We can also make this explicit:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(., y)
```

This is useful in case, where `x` does not refer to the first argument:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(y, z = .)
```


---
# Notes on Pipes' Styling: Indentions

We can write pipes in one line:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
u %>% v %>% w %>% x %>% y %>% z
```

Yet, this destroys the readability. At least for pipes with more than one `%>%` using multiple lines is easier to read:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
u %>% 
  v %>% 
  w %>% 
  x %>% 
  y %>% 
  z
```


---
# Notes on Pipes' Styling: Nesting I

As pipes are so convenient you may the tempted to nest operations within pipes and to merge separate processes, for example:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
obj_1 <- 
  u %>% 
  v %>% 
  w

z %>% 
  f(obj1, x) %>% 
  y
```


---
# Notes on Pipes' Styling: Nesting II
To:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
z %>% 
  f(
    u %>% 
      v %>% 
      w, 
    x
  ) %>% 
  y
```

While this is cool, it can get cumbersome to read

- It may be better to keep the processes be split up in pipes with more than one `%>%` operator 
- Hadley Wickham recommends never to use more than ten `%>%` anyway: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html#when-not-to-use-the-pipe


---
# Don't Overthink Pipes
.column-left-half[
Pipes are so nice, you may be tempted to use them all the time.

Some of you may even spend hours to create one single data preparation workflow in one single pipe.

This is awesome, however, it's not very sufficient and also misses the whole purpose of applying pipes which are:

- readability
- reproducibility

# Alternative Pipe Operators and Related Tools from `magrittr`

# t-Pipes

include_graphics("./mr_t_pipes.png")

# t-Pipes

t-Pipes create some kind of a loophole during a piping process.

They pause the current relationship between previous commands and the current one.

Moreover, they stop the inheritance of the output of the current command.

**t-Pipes can create intermediate results** such as

- plots
- tables

... and continue where we left the main pipe


---
# t-Pipes
```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
"mtcars.csv" %>% 
  readr_example() %>% 
  read_csv() %>% 
  .$mpg %T>% 
  plot() %>% # an intermediate plot
  mean()
```


---
# Exploding Pipes 
```{r, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("./exploding_pipes.png")
```

---
# Exploding Pipes
```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
"mtcars.csv" %>% 
  readr_example() %>% 
  read_csv() %>%
  cor(.$disp, .$mpg)
```

This produces an error because piping always expects whole objects, such as data frames, and no single vectors.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 4}
"mtcars.csv" %>% 
  readr_example() %>% 
  read_csv() %$% # 'exploding'
  cor(disp, mpg)
```


---
# `{}` Brackets

Another workaround for our problem are curly brackets.

They prevent the first argument to be `.`

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 4}
"mtcars.csv" %>% 
  readr_example() %>% 
  read_csv() %>% 
  { cor(.$disp, .$mpg) }
```

They are what you may know from other languages being called lamda-functions.


---
# What's left?
tidyverse pipes are only one implementation of pipes in R.

They are based on the implementation of the `magrittr` package.

Other implementations, not discussed here, would be:

- assignment pipes `%<>%`as an alternative to `<-`
- `pipeR`'s `%>>%` pipes


---
# tibbles
Tibbles are the data format used in the `tidyverse`.

They are basically standard `R data.frame()`s, enriched with some more features and metadata:

- information about size (rows x columns) of data
- information about variable types
- better readability
  - they fit to the screen automatically


---
# You've seen them already...
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
example_tibble <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
example_tibble
```


---
# How to use tibbles?

.middle[
Usually we don't have to do anything. 

tibbles are the standard output format of all tidyverse applications.

Yet, some old (or non-compliant) `R` functions may have some issues with tibbles. 

Luckily, we just can use `as.data.frame(your_tibble)` on them. Problem solved.

---
# Creating tibbles
Occasiaionly, we want to create `tibbles` from standard `data.frames`.

This can be done with the `tibble()`-function from the `tibble`-package.

```{r tibble-pic, out.width = "35%"}
include_graphics("./pics/tibble.png")
```

---
# Loading a standard data.frame

```{r standard-data-frame, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
titanic_df <- read.csv2("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv", sep = ",")
titanic_df
```


---
# Converting to a tibble

```{r convert-to-tibble, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
titanic_tibble <- 
  titanic_df %>% 
  as_tibble()

titanic_tibble
```

.center[VoilÃ !]


---
# Creating tibbles from scratch

Similar to creating `base R data.frames`, we can also create `tibbles` without any previous data input.

```{r from-scratch-tibble, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
tibble(
  a = 1:5,
  b = 20:16,
  c = letters[1:10] %>% 
    sample(., size = 5)
)
```

---
# tribbles
Using the `tribble`-approach is an way to create `tibbles` for small tables as it resembles the final layout of the table.

```{r tribble, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
tribble(
  ~a, ~b, ~c,
  1,  20,  "h",
  2,  19,  "j",
  3,  18,  "g",
  4,  17,  "i",
  5,  16,  "c"
)
```


---
# Summary

For now, we have to be familiar with two things when exploring the `tidyverse`:

1. pipes
  - they disentangle the process of data wrangling in simple chunks
  - denoted by the operator `%>%`, yet there are alternatives we should be aware of 
2. tibbles
  - an easy to read and modern format for datasets in `R`
  - standard format of the `tidyverse`
