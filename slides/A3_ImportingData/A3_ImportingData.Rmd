# Data, Data, Data

--
Thus far, we've already learned that data can be untidy.


--
This course is all about making them tidy again (...or maybe for the first time?).


--
There's one rather important prerequisite, however:

<h2> Getting Data in the tidyverse </h2>

Whether we want to use our own data or that from others, we need to get data into R.

tidyverse provides some nice tools to do so:

- `readr`  (for 'flat' files, such as CSV)
- `readxl` (for excel spreadsheets)
- `haven`  (for statistical software files, such as SPSS, Stata, and SAS)

The difference to other tool is that tidyverse import functions already prepare the data for being 'tidyed': they are a tibbles

![](hex_all_in_one.png)]

---
# A readr example: `read_csv()`
```{r readr_example, echo = TRUE}
titanic <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
```

---
# A readr example: `read_csv()`
```{r readr_example:output, echo = TRUE}
titanic
```

It's that easy.

---
# A readxl example: `read_excel()`
```{r readxl_example, echo = TRUE}
unicorns <- read_xlsx("../../data/unicorns/observations.xlsx")
```

No output :-(

---
# A readxl example: `read_excel()`
```{r readxl_example_output, echo = TRUE}
unicorns
```

---
# A haven example: `read_stata()` 
```{r read_stata_example, echo = TRUE}
gesis_panel <- 
  read_stata("../../data/gesis_panel_campusfile/ZA5666_v1-0-0_Stata14.dta")
```

---
# A haven example: `read_stata()` 
```{r read_stata_example_output, echo = TRUE}
gesis_panel
```

---
# There's More
These were just some very first examples of applying functions from each package.

- readr
  - `read_csv()`
  - `read_tsv()`
  - `read_delim()`
  - `read_fwf()`
  - `read_table()`
  - `read_log()`
- haven
  - `read_sas()`
  - `read_spss()`
  - `read_stata()`

Not to mention all the helper files and options. For example, we can define the cells to read from an excel file by applying the option `range = "C1:E4"` in
`read_excel()`


---
# Data Specifics
- characters
- integers
- doubles

---
# Changing Variable Types
For example, `read_csv` 'guesses' the variable types which can go wrong.

Luckily, we can change the variable type -- before and after loading the data

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`

---
# After Loading the data



---
# Exporting Data
Sometimes we also have to leave R and its tidy world.

- We share data with colleagues
- We wanna start where we left the next day
  - Particularly, when data tidying to a long time
  
For these purposes, we also have to need a way to export our data.

All tools presented also have designated functions for that.

---
# Example: CSV and Stata files
```{r export_csv, echo = TRUE}
write_csv(titanic, "titanic_own.csv")
```

Maybe more relevant:
```{r export_stata, echo = TRUE}
write_dta(titanic, "titanic_own.dta")
```

---
# Additional Packages
The great benefit of tidyverse import functions is the import of the data as tibbles: the data are potentially more tidy.

Several other non-tidyverse packages provide similar benefits as they make use of this universal data format:
- `sf` (for geospatial data)
- ...

---
# Alternative Packages

- `base` R
- the good old `foreign` package for spss and stata files 
- `data.table` for large data tables
