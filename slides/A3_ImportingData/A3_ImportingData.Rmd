# Getting data in `R`

.large[
Thus far, we've already learned that data can be untidy.

This course is also about making them tidy again.

There's one important prerequisite:

.center[**We need data!**]
]

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("./pics/import_data.png")
```

# Getting Data in the tidyverse

Whether we want to use our own data or that from others, we need to get data into R.

tidyverse provides some nice tools to do exactly this:

- `readr`  (for 'flat' files, such as CSV)
- `readxl` (for excel spreadsheets)
- `haven`  (for statistical software files, such as SPSS, Stata, and SAS)

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("./pics/hex_all_in_one.png")
```

The difference to other tool is that tidyverse import functions already prepare the data for being 'tidyed': they are a `tibbles`


---
# A readr example: `read_csv()`
```{r readr_example, echo = TRUE}
titanic <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
```

Please note the column specification.

- `readr` 'guesses' them based on the first 1000 observations
- We'll come back to this a little bit later


---
# A readr example: `read_csv()`
```{r readr_example:output, echo = TRUE}
titanic
```

It's that easy.

---
# A readxl example: `read_excel()`
```{r readxl_example, echo = TRUE}
unicorns <- read_xlsx("../../data/unicorns/observations.xlsx")
```

No output :-(

---
# A readxl example: `read_excel()`
```{r readxl_example_output, echo = TRUE}
unicorns
```

---
# A haven example: `read_stata()` 
```{r read_stata_example, echo = TRUE}
gesis_panel <- 
  read_stata("../../data/gesis_panel_campusfile/ZA5666_v1-0-0_Stata14.dta")
```

---
# A haven example: `read_stata()` 
```{r read_stata_example_output, echo = TRUE}
gesis_panel
```

---
# There's more
These were just some very first examples of applying functions from each package. They comprise even more functions for different data types.

- readr
  - `read_csv()`
  - `read_tsv()`
  - `read_delim()`
  - `read_fwf()`
  - `read_table()`
  - `read_log()`
- haven
  - `read_sas()`
  - `read_spss()`
  - `read_stata()`

Not to mention all the helper files and options. For example, we can define the cells to read from an excel file by applying the option `range = "C1:E4"` in
`read_excel()`

# Changing Variable Types
As mentioned, `read_csv` 'guesses' the variable types

- it scans the first 1000 oberservations
- **This can go wrong!**

Luckily, we can change the variable type

- before resp. while loading the data
- and after loading the data

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_change, echo = TRUE}
titanic <-
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv",
    col_types = cols(
      PassengerId = col_double(),
      Survived = col_double(),
      Pclass = col_double(),
      Name = col_character(),
      Sex = col_character(),
      Age = col_double(),
      SibSp = col_double(),
      Parch = col_double(),
      Ticket = col_character(),
      Fare = col_double(),
      Cabin = col_character(),
      Embarked = col_character()
    )
  )
```

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_change_display, echo = TRUE}
titanic
```

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_changeD, echo = TRUE}
titanic <-
  read_csv(
    "../../data/titanic/titanic.csv",
    col_types = cols(
      PassengerId = col_double(),
      Survived = col_double(),
      Pclass = col_double(),
      Name = col_character(),
      Sex = col_factor(), # This one's now changed!
      Age = col_double(),
      SibSp = col_double(),
      Parch = col_double(),
      Ticket = col_character(),
      Fare = col_double(),
      Cabin = col_character(),
      Embarked = col_character()
    )
  )
```

---
# While Loading the data in `read_csv`
```{r readr_example_col_changeD_display, echo = TRUE}
titanic
```

---
# After Loading the data
```{r readr_example_col_change_after, echo = TRUE}
titanic <- read_csv("../../data/titanic/titanic.csv")
```

---
# After Loading the data
```{r readr_example_col_changeD_after, echo = TRUE}
titanic <-
  type_convert(
    titanic,
    col_types = cols(
      PassengerId = col_double(),
      Survived = col_double(),
      Pclass = col_double(),
      Name = col_character(),
      Sex = col_factor(), # This one's now changed!
      Age = col_double(),
      SibSp = col_double(),
      Parch = col_double(),
      Ticket = col_character(),
      Fare = col_double(),
      Cabin = col_character(),
      Embarked = col_character()
    )
  )
```

# Exporting Data
Sometimes we also have to leave R and its tidy world.

- If we share data with colleagues
- If we aim to start where we left the next day
  - Particularly, when data wrangling took a long time
  
For these purposes, we also need a way to export our data.

All tools presented also have designated functions for that.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("./pics/export_data.png")
```

---
# Example: CSV and Stata files
```{r export_csv, echo = TRUE}
write_csv(titanic, "titanic_own.csv")
```

Maybe more relevant:
```{r export_stata, echo = TRUE}
write_dta(titanic, "titanic_own.dta")
```

Proof that they have been exported:
```{r list_files, echo = TRUE}
list.files() 
```

---
# Additional Packages
The great benefit of tidyverse import functions is the import of the data as tibbles: the data are potentially more tidy.

Several other non-tidyverse packages provide similar benefits as they make use of this universal data format:
- `sf` for geospatial data
- `sjlabelled` to work with labelled data, e.g., from SPSS or Stata

---
# Alternative Packages
- `base` R
- the good old `foreign` package for spss and stata files 
- `data.table` for large data tables
