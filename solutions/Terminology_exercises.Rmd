This is the very firt exercise of this course. It's not too hard, its purpose is rather to get used to our exercise format - this HTML file, for instance - and more importantly, to get used to the `tidyverse` world.

Consequently, this exercise is really short and just let you play around with some pipes and tibbles. It's a mini-exercise!

First things first: To work with the 'tidyverse' we have to have access to its packages.

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Load the `tidyverse` library.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
If the `tidyverse` library has not been installed yet, you can install it with the command `install.packages("tidyverse")`.
```

```{r load_tidyverse_solution, solution = TRUE, message = FALSE}
if (!require(easypackages)) install.packages("easypackages")
library(easypackages)
```
